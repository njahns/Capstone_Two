As a data wrangling exercise, I downloaded lake water quality data from the EPA's National Water Quality Monitoring Council webpage and cleaned it so the data could be used for a machine learning model. These data could not be downloaded from the portal as one file and were broken up into nine CSV files. When combined, the CSV file totaled 10.24 GB which was near the limit for my computer to handle. Therefore, my priority during cleaning was to remove features and rows I did not need. This included any data collected at a depth greater than 3 meters. In addition, the EPA data was very messy and I had to make many assumptions and heavily edit.
